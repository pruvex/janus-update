# KNOWLEDGE BASE: WHAT I LEARNED

## [PATTERN] #WeatherFormatterOwnsCrossProviderParity "Weather answers should be normalized in the product formatter, not left to provider style"
- **Kontext:** BACKLOG-095 / Weather API response parity and documentation closure.
- **Problem:** GPT/HPZ and Gemini can both produce correct weather facts but wrap them in different surface styles, which creates a UX split even when the underlying data is the same.
- **Loesung:** Put the user-facing weather contract in a deterministic formatter and make the finalizer prefer the structured weather forecast text over provider-generated prose. Keep location, period, weather state, temperatures, rain probability, wind and a clear source line together in one stable layout.
- **Haertung:** Focused weather renderer and attribution tests passed; focused regression checks stayed green; live weather output now matches the shared bulletpoint format for GPT/HPZ and Gemini.
- **Tripwire:** If a future weather answer returns the same facts but different provider-specific prose, the formatter/finalizer path has drifted and should be corrected before touching provider prompts.
- **Location:** `backend/tools/weather_service.py`, `backend/renderers/implementations/weather_renderer.py`, `backend/renderers/attribution.py`, `backend/services/orchestrator/execution_engine.py`, `backend/services/orchestrator/response_finalizer.py`
- **Epic:** BACKLOG-095
- **Confidence:** High

## [PATTERN] #FrontendConsoleMirrorForChatState "Renderer console logs should be mirrored to documentation/logs for chat-state debugging"
- **Kontext:** BACKLOG-096 / Chat-header new-chat persistence and observability closure.
- **Problem:** Frontend-only state regressions, especially window-local chat header overrides, are hard to diagnose when only backend stream logs are available.
- **Loesung:** Mirror renderer console output from the Electron main process into `documentation/logs/janus_frontend.log` alongside `janus_backend.log`, so UI state transitions like `createNewChat`, `loadChat`, header override sync and related warnings can be read in one place.
- **Haertung:** New log sink written via `mainWindow.webContents.on('console-message', ...)` and validated by syntax checks plus manual Janus retest. The frontend log now captures the new-chat flow needed to verify GPT and Gemini behavior side by side.
- **Tripwire:** If frontend regressions can no longer be matched against backend streams in the same log folder, the renderer log sink has been removed or broken.
- **Location:** `main.electron.cjs`, `documentation/logs/janus_frontend.log`
- **Epic:** BACKLOG-096
